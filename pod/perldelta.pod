=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file. Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.41.7

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.41.6 release and the 5.41.7
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.41.5, first read
L<perl5416delta>, which describes differences between 5.41.5 and 5.41.6.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 New C<:writer> attribute on field variables

Classes defined using C<use feature 'class'> are now able to automatically
create writer accessors for scalar fields, by using the C<:writer> attribute,
similar to the way that C<:reader> already creates reader accessors.

    class Point {
        field $x :reader :writer :param;
        field $y :reader :writer :param;
    }

    my $p = Point->new( x => 20, y => 40 );
    $p->set_x(60);

=head2 New C<any> and C<all> operators

A new experimental feature has been added, which adds two new list-processing
operators, C<any> and C<all>.

    use v5.40;
    use feature 'all';

    my @numbers = ...

    if(all { $_ % 2 == 0 } @numbers) {
        say "All the numbers are even";
    }

These operate similarly to C<grep> except that they only ever return true or
false, testing if any (or all) of the elements in the list make the testing
block yield true.  Because of this they can short-circuit, avoiding the need
to test any further elements if a given element determines the eventual
result.

These are inspired by the same-named functions in the L<List::Util> module,
except that they are implemented as direct core operators, and thus perform
faster, and do not produce an additional subroutine call stack frame for
invoking the code block.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here. In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report. See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if not applicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<deprecated>-category
warnings to alert you to this fact. To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use. Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

There may well be none in a stable release.

XXX

=item *

Code that uses the C<indexed> function from the L<builtin> module to generate
a list of index/value pairs out of an array or list which is then passed into
a two-variable C<foreach> list to unpack those again is now optimised to be
more efficient.

    my @array = (...);

    foreach my ($idx, $val) (builtin::indexed @array) {
        ...
    }

Z<>

    foreach my ($idx, $val) (builtin::indexed LIST...) {
        ...
    }

In particular, a temporary list twice the size of the original is no longer
generated.  Instead, the loop iterates down the original array or list
in-place directly, in the same way that C<foreach (@array)> or
C<foreach (LIST)> would do.

=back

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here. If L<Module::CoreList> is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>. A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand. In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

The list of new and updated modules is modified automatically as part of
preparing a Perl release, so the only reason to manually add entries here is if
you're summarising the important changes in the module update. (Also, if the
manually-added details don't match the automatically-generated ones, the
release manager will have to investigate the situation carefully.)

The (mostly undocumented) configuration macro C<PERL_STRICT_CR> has been
removed. When enabled (e.g. with C<./Configure -A ccflags=-DPERL_STRICT_CR>),
it would make the perl parser throw a fatal error when it encountered a CR
(carriage return) character in source files. The default (and now only)
behavior of the perl parser is to strip CRs paired with newline characters and
otherwise treat them as whitespace.

(C<PERL_STRICT_CR> was originally introduced in perl 5.005 to optionally
restore backward compatibility with perl 5.004, which had made CR in source
files an error. Before that, CR was accepted, but retained literally in quoted
multi-line constructs such as here-documents, even at the end of a line.)

=item *

Similarly, the (even less documented) configuration macro C<PERL_CR_FILTER> has
been removed. When enabled, it would install a default source filter to strip
carriage returns from source code before the parser proper got to see it.

New API functions are introduced to convert strings encoded in UTF-8 to
their ordinal code point equivalent.  These are safe to use by default,
and generally more convenient to use than the existing ones.

L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_uv>> and L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_uv_or_die>> replace
L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_uvchr>> (which is retained for backwards
compatibility), but you should convert to use the new forms, as likely
you aren't using the old one safely.

To convert in the opposite direction, you can now use
L<perlapi/C<uv_to_utf8>>.  This is not a new function, but a new synonym
for L<perlapi/C<uvchr_to_utf8>>.  It is added so you don't have to learn
two sets of names.

There are also two new functions, L<perlapi/C<strict_utf8_to_uv>> and
L<perlapi/C<c9strict_utf8_to_uv>> which do the same thing except when
the input string represents a code point that Unicode doesn't accept as
legal for interchange, using either the strict original definition
(C<strict_utf8_to_uv>), or the looser one given by
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|https://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>
(C<c9strict_utf8_to_uv>).  When the input string represents one of the
restricted code points, these functions return the Unicode
C<REPLACEMENT CHARACTER> instead.

Also L<perlapi/C<extended_utf8_to_uv>> is a synonym for C<utf8_to_uv>, for use
when you want to emphasize that the entire range of Perl extended UTF-8
is acceptable.

There are also replacement functions for the three more specialized
conversion functions that you are unlikely to need to use.  Again, the
old forms are kept for backwards compatibility, but you should convert
to use the new forms.

L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_uv_flags>> replaces L<perlapi/C<utf8n_to_uvchr>>.

L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_uv_errors>> replaces L<perlapi/C<utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>.

L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_uv_msgs>> replaces
L<perlapi/C<utf8n_to_uvchr_msgs>>.

Also added are the inverse functions L<perlapi/C<uv_to_utf8_flags>>
and L<perlapi/C<uv_to_utf8_msgs>>, which are synonyms for the existing
functions, L<perlapi/C<uvchr_to_utf8_flags>> and
L<perlapi/C<uvchr_to_utf8_flags_msgs>> respectively.  These are provided only
so you don't have to learn two sets of names.

=item *

Three new API functions are introduced to convert strings encoded in
UTF-8 to native bytes format (if possible).  These are easier to use
than the existing ones, and they avoid unnecessary memory allocations.
The functions are L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_bytes_overwrite>> which is used
when it is ok for the input string to be overwritten with the converted
result; and L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_bytes_new_pv>> and
L<perlapi/C<utf8_to_bytes_temp_pv>> when the original string must be
preserved intact.  C<utf8_to_bytes_temp_pv> returns the result in a
temporary using L<perlapi>/C<SAVEFREEPV> that will automatically be
destroyed.  With C<utf8_to_bytes_new_pv>, you are responsible for
freeing the newly allocated memory that is returned if the conversion is
successful.

The latter two functions are designed to replace
L<perlapi/C<bytes_from_utf8>> which creates memory unnecessarily, or
unnecessarily large.

=item *

New API functions L<C<valid_identifier_pve()>|perlapi/valid_identifier_pve>,
L<C<valid_identifier_pvn()>|perlapi/valid_identifier_pvn> and
L<C<valid_identifier_sv()>|perlapi/valid_identifier_sv> have been added, which
test if a string would be considered by Perl to be a valid identifier name.

=item *

When assigning from an SVt_IV into a SVt_NV (or vice versa), providing that
both are "bodyless" types, Perl_sv_setsv_flags will now just change the
destination type to match the source type. Previously, an SVt_IV would have
been upgraded to a SVt_PVNV to store an NV, and an SVt_NV would have been
upgraded to a SVt_PVIV to store an IV. This change prevents the need to
allocate - and later free - the relevant body struct.
